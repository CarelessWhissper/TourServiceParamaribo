            Chef Gordon Ramsay modernizes the classic Beef Wellington recipe
            with his trusty cast iron skillet, which gives the beef fillet
            color, depth, and flavor. Dijon mustard tenderizes, marinates, and
            gives a gentle kick to the filet mignon. Layers of prosciutto,
            savory chive crepe, a mushroom mixture, and puff pastry literally
            seal the deal.

              A martini is one of the best upscale drinks, especially when you
              want to impress. An American invention, the martini was
              popularized by James Bond. You can drink it as it is without
              shaking or stirring it. Whether you order the dirty martini or any
              way you like it, this is one of the most upscale drinks.
